Hwanhee said that in this case, where we have a factor variable, there are two main ways we can think about Y. First, we can construct our Y vector as a \\(n\\text{ x } 1\\) dimmensional vector. The model formula, then, would look like this: \\(Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i + \\epsilon\\), where \\(X_i = \\begin{cases}1, \\quad \\text{From town}\\\\0, \\quad \\text{From city} \\end{cases}\\). The other way to think about this is to construct our \\(Y\\) vector to be \\(j \\text{ x } k\\) dimmensional, where \\(j\\) is the number of levels of our factor variable and \\(k\\) is the number of individuals in group \\(j\\). In this case, the model formula would be \\(Y_{jk} = \\mu + \\alpha_j + \\epsilon_k\\), where \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of the reference group and \\(\\alpha\\) is the difference between the means of the reference group and group \\(j\\)."
