## Exponential Family 

* When an outcome is continuous, we consider a LR model like to be: $E(Y_i) = \mu_i = X_i^T \beta$, where $T_i \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma^2)$
* For models with non-continuous outcomes, the distribution of $Y_i$ is not normal. However, they may be in the **exponential family** and can share some of the nice properties of normality
* Exponential family definition:
  * Distribution of Y belongs to the exponential family if it can be written in the form $f(y; \theta) = exp[a(y)b(\theta) + c(\theta) + d(y)]$
  * Canonical form: if $a(y) = y$, the distribution is in canonical form and $b(\theta)$ is said to be the natural parameter
  * If there are other parameters other than the parameter of interest (say $\sigma^2$ when we're interested in $\mu$), these are said to be nuisance parameters

## Examples

### Example 1: Poisson distribution 

> Is the Poisson PDF in canonical form? If so, what is the natural parameter? 

Poisson PDF: $f(y; \theta) = \frac{\theta^y e^{-\theta}}{y!}, \quad y = 0, 1, 2, ...$

* $f(y; \theta) = exp[y \log (\theta) - \theta - log(y!)]$
* $a(y) = y$
* $b(\theta) = \log(\theta)$
* $c(\theta) = -\theta$
* $d(y) = -\log(y!)$

Yes, it's in canonical form, and the natural parameter is $\log(\theta)$. Easy peasy. 

### Example 2: Normal distribution 

> What is the nuisance parameter? Is it in canonical form? What (if yes) is the natural parameter?


\begin{align*}
f(y; \theta) &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} exp\left[-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(y - \mu)^2\right]\\
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} exp\left[\frac{y\mu}{\sigma^2} - \frac{\mu^2}{2\sigma^2}-\frac{y^2}{2\sigma^2}\right]\\
&= exp\left[\frac{y\mu}{\sigma^2} - \frac{\mu^2}{2\sigma^2}-\frac{y^2}{2\sigma^2} -\frac{1}{2}log(2\pi\sigma^2)  \right]\\
\end{align*}

* $a(y) = y$
* $b(\mu) = \frac{\mu}{\sigma^2}$
* $c(\mu) = \frac{\mu^2}{2\sigma^2}$
* $d(y) = - \frac{y^2}{2\sigma^2} - \frac{log(2\pi\sigma^2)}{2}$

The nuisance parameter is $\sigma^2$. It is in canonical form, and the natural parameter is $\mu/\sigma^2$.


## Properties of the Exponential Family

Why do we care about the exponential family? Because it has some really useful properties. Specifically, we're going to learn about calculating the mean and variance. 

* Property 1: $E[a(y)] = -c'(\theta)/b'(\theta)$
* Property 2: $Var[a(y)] = \frac{b''(\theta) c'(\theta) - c''(\theta)b'(\theta)}{[b'(\theta)]^3}$

## The Score Function

Recall that the score function (or score statistic) is the first derivative of the log-likelihood function. Note that because it is a function of Y, it is considered a random variable. There are two extremely interesting properties of the score function. 

Let the random variable U represent the score function. 

* Property 1: $E[U] = 0$
* Property 2: $Var[U] = \frac{b''(\theta)c'(\theta)}{b'(\theta)} - c''(\theta) = I(\theta)$, where $I(\theta)$ is the Fisher's information of $\theta$. Isn't that crazy? The variance of the first derivative of the log-likelihood is the Fisher's information. 

## Three Take-aways

1. Suppose f(y; \theta) is a PDF. How must f(y; \theta) be written to conclude that it belongs to the exponential family?
2. Property 1 of the exponential family has to do with E[a(y)]. What is the property?
3. Property 2 of the exponential family has to do with V(a(y)). What is the property?
